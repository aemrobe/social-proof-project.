## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

in this section i learned about responsive design
the thing which peoples should do to make your website responsive is to avoid fixed width values such as px (instead use % values, em values ).

and another tip use percentage values for the width and height ,
for the margin and padding you should use em values

### Continued development

for the future projects I want to focus on flexbox and css grid and specially how to use flexbox and css grid for responsive design.

### Useful resources
